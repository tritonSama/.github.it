### **1. Project Overview**

#### **Goal**:
Develop a decentralized **guild-based platform** where users (mages) can:
- Join guilds, take on tasks, and earn rewards (cryptocurrency or tokens) via **Solana**.
- Integrate Solana blockchain for fast, low-cost payments, creating a **task marketplace** where jobs are posted and completed.
- Implement a **token economy** (Solana-based tokens) for rewarding users and managing transactions.

---

### **2. Key Features**
- **User Management (Mage Class)**: Registration, login, profile management, and roles (mage, guild leader, admin).
- **Guild System**: Users can join and create guilds, with guild leaders posting tasks and jobs for mages to complete.
- **Task Marketplace**: A marketplace where guilds post tasks/jobs and mages can apply for them.
- **Solana Token Economy**: Earn rewards in Solana-based tokens for completing tasks.
- **Transaction System**: Users will be able to view their earnings, track their transaction history, and make withdrawals.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage users, guilds, tasks, and oversee the flow of tokens.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for job assignments, task updates, and guild events.
- **Security**: User authentication, blockchain-based wallets, and secure transaction handling.

---

### **3. Architecture Overview**

#### **Frontend**:
- **Technology Stack**: React.js, Next.js, or Vue.js (Single-page application framework), Tailwind CSS (for responsive design)
- **UI Components**:
  - Registration/Login Forms
  - Dashboard (user dashboard for earnings and tasks, admin dashboard)
  - Job Marketplace (task listing, job details, applications)
  - Wallet Integration (for Solana transactions)
  - Notifications (for task assignments, job completions, new tasks)

#### **Backend**:
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js / Express.js (or your preferred backend tech), with Solana Web3.js for blockchain interactions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase for user data, guilds, tasks, and transaction history
- **Authentication**: Solana wallet integration for user authentication (Sollet, Phantom, Solflare wallets)
- **Blockchain Integration**: Solana for payments, reward distribution, and wallet management

#### **Blockchain (Solana)**:
- **Solana Token**: Integrate a custom Solana-based token for payments (similar to how ERC20 tokens are used on Ethereum).
  - **Tools**: Solana Web3.js SDK for interacting with Solana blockchain, creating tokens, and processing transactions.
- **Wallet Integration**: Users will interact with the app via Solana-compatible wallets (Phantom, Sollet, Solflare).
- **Solana Smart Contracts**: Use Solana's **Rust** or **Anchor framework** for smart contract development (if needed for tasks, payments, and rewards).

---

### **4. Development Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Gathering**

1. **Define Functional Requirements**:
   - Define key features: guild creation, task posting, user roles (mage, guild leader, admin), job completion, token reward system, etc.
   - Design how Solana tokens will be used for payments (e.g., mages will earn tokens upon completing tasks).
   - Decide how transaction fees will be managed using Solana's low-cost structure.

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - Confirm the frontend (React.js or Vue.js) and backend stack (Node.js, Express).
   - Choose Solana-compatible wallet libraries like **Sollet**, **Phantom**, or **Solflare** for Solana wallet integration.
   - Design database schemas for users, guilds, tasks, payments, and transactions.

3. **System Architecture**:
   - Design system architecture: how the frontend will communicate with the backend, and how the backend will interact with Solana for transactions.
   - Design data flow diagrams: guild creation, task assignment, task completion, payment distribution, and wallet interaction.

4. **Wireframes and UI Design**:
   - Create wireframes or mockups for the core pages (login, dashboard, job marketplace, guild management).
   - Focus on clean UI design, user flows, and Solana wallet integration for transactions.

---

#### **Phase 2: Frontend Development**

1. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Create the homepage (to replace the temporary under-construction page).
   - Implement the user dashboard where users can see tasks, jobs, earnings, and transaction history.
   - Build the job marketplace where guild leaders can post tasks and mages can browse and apply for them.
   - Implement wallet integration, allowing users to connect their **Solana wallet** (e.g., Phantom) for earning and withdrawing tokens.

2. **State Management**:
   - Use a state management library (e.g., Redux, Context API) to manage state across the app: user authentication, tasks, guilds, earnings, and wallet transactions.
   - Handle Solana token transactions within the app’s state.

3. **Task Marketplace**:
   - Implement the task marketplace where guilds can post jobs with reward details in Solana tokens.
   - Enable mages to apply for tasks and view task progress.

4. **Solana Wallet Integration**:
   - Implement integration for Solana wallets (Phantom, Sollet, etc.) using **Solana Web3.js**.
   - Implement features to allow users to view wallet balance, send/receive tokens, and complete transactions.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the platform works across different devices, ensuring responsive layouts using **Tailwind CSS**.

---

#### **Phase 3: Backend Development**

1. **Backend API Setup**:
   - Set up the backend (Node.js with Express or another framework).
   - Define and implement API routes:
     - User registration/login (with wallet integration)
     - Guild management (creating, joining, leaving)
     - Task management (posting tasks, applying for jobs)
     - Transaction management (handling Solana token transactions)

2. **Solana Blockchain Integration**:
   - Use **Solana Web3.js** to interact with the blockchain. For example:
     - Create and manage Solana-based tokens.
     - Issue token rewards to mages upon task completion.
     - Handle user wallet connections, transaction submissions, and transaction confirmations.

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Design database schema for:
     - **Users**: Include user wallet addresses, profile info, and earnings.
     - **Guilds**: Guild names, descriptions, members, leader roles.
     - **Tasks**: Task name, description, reward (in Solana tokens), assigned mage.
     - **Transactions**: Amount, task ID, transaction time, status (completed/pending).
   - Implement CRUD operations for managing users, guilds, and tasks.

4. **Solana Token Rewards System**:
   - Integrate Solana token rewards for mages: Once a task is completed, the backend will send tokens to the mage's wallet.
   - Implement a **smart contract** (using Solana’s **Rust** or **Anchor** framework) to automate token distribution based on task completion.

---

#### **Phase 4: Payment & Reward System**

1. **Solana Token Integration**:
   - Use Solana’s low-cost transaction features to send and receive tokens for task completions.
   - Allow users to view their wallet balances in their dashboard.
   - Set up automatic payments to mages when they complete a job/task.

2. **Transaction Management**:
   - Implement transaction history so users can track incoming and outgoing payments.
   - Handle **Solana transaction fees** to ensure smooth payments (if any).

---

#### **Phase 5: Admin Dashboard & Guild Management**

1. **Admin Panel**:
   - Build an admin dashboard for monitoring users, guilds, tasks, and token transactions.
   - Enable admin control over guilds (creating, deleting, and managing guilds) and tasks (approving or rejecting tasks).

2. **Guild Leader Dashboard**:
   - Guild leaders can manage tasks, assign jobs, track progress, and distribute tokens to members.
   - Ensure that guild leaders can easily post tasks and set rewards in Solana tokens.

---

#### **Phase 6: Testing & QA**

1. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Ensure that UI components are responsive and that users can connect their Solana wallet, browse tasks, and view earnings.
   - Test interactions with the wallet, ensuring smooth token transactions and confirmations.

2. **Backend Testing**:
   - Test API endpoints for creating, joining guilds, posting tasks, and earning rewards.
   - Ensure correct token distribution to users via Solana’s network.

3. **Solana Blockchain Testing**:
   - Conduct test transactions on Solana's devnet or testnet to simulate task completion and token transfers.

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Ensure that wallet integration is secure and that users can’t manipulate wallet balances or tasks.

---

#### **Phase 7: Deployment**

1. **Deployment of Backend**:
   - Deploy backend on cloud services like **AWS**, **DigitalOcean**, or **Heroku**.
   - Set up **Solana wallet** integration with the backend to ensure seamless wallet-to-backend communication.
